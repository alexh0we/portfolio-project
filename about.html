        <p>My name is Alex Howe. I'm a junior fullstack softwear engineer and a fellow at Pursuit. This is my first solo app, and the first of my portfolio projects, so, needless to say, I'm excited to share it with anyone who wants to play around with it. But more than that, I'm excited to look back at this in the future, where I'll be able to see how far I've come. I really enoyed playing with this data and creating a theme that felt like it was true to the spirit of Pok√©mon.</p>
